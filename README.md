# Credit-Card-Fraud-detection


Credit card fraud detection is presently the most frequently occurring problem in
the present world. This is happening due to the growth of e-commerce platforms
as well as online transactions. In most cases, credit card fraud occurs when the
card is stolen and used for any unauthorized activity, or even when the fraudster
utilizes the cardâ€™s information for his own gain. We have a lot of credit card
issues in the modern world. In the present world, we are facing a lot of credit
card problems. To detect the fraudulent activities the credit card fraud detection
system was introduced. This project aims to focus mainly on machine learning
algorithms. The classifiers used are Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor,
Decision tree and Support Vector Classifier . The results of all the algorithms are
based on accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. All the algorithms are compared
and the algorithm that has the greatest accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score is
again implemented using LIME considered as the best algorithm which is used
to detect the fraud.
